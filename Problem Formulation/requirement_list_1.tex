\subsection{Requirements set by Teachers:}
The technical focus this semester lays on sensor and actuator technology for mechatronic products.
\\
This should be applied in the prototype of a autonomous vehicle.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Object avoidance
    \item Mechanical parts from RC-platform, or own Design(3D printing or Laser cutting)
    \item !
    \item At least 2 Analog sensors
    \item At least 1 Analog filter
    \item !
    \item Basic Artificial Intelligence for avoidance/steering/braking
    \item no machine learning
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Project requirements:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Working prototype,tested and documented
    \item Risk analysis(small part, 1-2 pages)
    \item User interaction / requirement study
    \item Hardware\begin{enumerate}
        \item 1 analog sensor( stated 2 above)
        \item Motor control / driver, can be a module
        \item At least one small designed custom PCB
        \item Basic Mechanics

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Software of own choice
    \item Max 1000kr new stuff
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Safety basics:}
We have to implement the base of a Risk-analysis based on IEC14971 Standard for medical devices.
This has to include functional risk and operator/person safety risk. Subjects can be Hazard, Likelyhood
of occurrence and  itÂ´s Severity

\subsection{Project requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove of concept
    \item down scaled version of a autonomous forklift
    \item Maximum size of pallet: (to be decided)
    \item Maximum size of vehicle: (to be decided)
    \item modular?
    \item load and unload pallets from truck?
    \item stack pallets up to 2nd level (total of 2 levels (1 and 2))
    \item drive with a 2 pallets stacked
\end{enumerate}
Further requirements for the movement are to be defined but the base lays in not driving
into anything ( including stopping when object moves infront of drive path), and moving
pallets without preprogrammed paths ergo autonomously.
