\subsection{Outlined requirements:}
This semester, the emphasis is on sensor technology and analog electronics for
mechatronic products, with a specific focus on applying these concepts in the
prototype of an autonomous vehicle. The semester supervisors have outlined
specific requirements that must be incorporated into the project.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Working prototype,tested and documented
    \item Risk analysis(small part, 1-2 pages)
    \item User interaction / requirement study
    \item Hardware\begin{enumerate}
        \item 2 analog sensor
        \item 1 Analog filter
        \item Motor control / driver, can be a module
        \item At least one small designed custom PCB
        \item Basic Mechanics
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Functionality\begin{enumerate}
        \item Object avoidance
        \item Self driving
        \item No machine learning
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Budget of maximum 1000 DKK
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Safety basics:}
We have to implement the base of a Risk-analysis. % based on IEC14971 Standard for medical devices.
This has to include functional risk and operator/person safety risk. Subjects can be hazard, likelyhood
of occurrence and itÂ´s severity.
