\subsection{Company Engagement}
In our pursuit of innovation, we engaged in meaningful conversations with
potential businesses, seeking feedback on our project. Companies where
forklifts are operated in warehouses with high levels of food traffic were of
particular interest.

The local department of the international chain Bauhaus was contacted. What is
particularly interesting about this business is that its warehouses are
integrated into the shop, allowing customers to walk around the same space.
Even though Bauhaus warehouse manager (Martin Hansen) could see the potential in
an autonomous forklift, he could not imagine them driving around in his
warehouse in its current state. With the current sensor capabilities, it
would not live up to Bauhaus's strict requirements to ensure customer safety. He
thinks that the project would be more suited for distribution warehouses, where
only trained personnel would be on the ground floor. In conclusion, the
interview provided insights into the project's target market.
