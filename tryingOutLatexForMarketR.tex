    \subsection{Market Research}
    A research paper from a japanese university revealed that in countries with aging demographics autonomous vehicles such as an autonomous forklift are required to lighten the burden on manpower and manual labor. The authors of this paper detailed an autonomous pallet handling system for forklifts, which is able to handle pallets used for harvesting vegetables with no further human input in an outdoors environment.

    From a paper about aging populations it is stated that 11\% of the world is over 60 years of age and this ratio is expected to rise up to 22\% in 2050.

    These two papers clearly indicate a need for more automation in order to support the ever-growing population of this planet, where a larger and larger part of residents are no longer able to do highly physically demanding task.
