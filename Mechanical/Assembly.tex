\subsection{Assembly}
    The assembly serves several purposes in the manufacturing process. One
    notable benefit is the ability to ensure that newly designed models fit
    into the assembly, allowing for a preliminary check before investing time
    in manufacturing the actual model. The time invested in the assembly
    ultimately translates into time saved during the redesign and
    re-manufacturing phases.

    Another advantage is that the assembly provides a visualization of the
    final model. This can be used in conversations to prevent misunderstandings
    that can result in feature mistakes. Having a visual representation
    facilitates clearer communication, reducing the likelihood of errors and
    ensuring that the design aligns with the intended specifications.
