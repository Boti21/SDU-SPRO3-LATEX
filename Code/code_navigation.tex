\subsection{Navigation alternatives}
The forklift has to find its way around in the real world. In the end it should
according to the project requirements find and drive to a pallet space. 

\textbf{Unfinished}

            1.1& Different colored lines on the floor &
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Different colored lines allow easy target management
                \item Relatively simple algorithms for car control + obstacle avoidance
                \item Cheap in price
                \item Customer can put a custom pattern
                \item Easy to test and debug
            \end{itemize}&
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Calibration of color sensors - shifts with different light levels (Especially an issue at TekExpo)
                \item Not as challenging academically - it has been done before
                \item Not flexible - for long term changes the grid has to be redone
            \end{itemize}
            & Color sensor 80 to 140kr

            must be and then switch over to pallet
            detection algorithm& \begin{itemize}
                \item Learning about GPS and Gyroscopes
                \item Flexible and adaptable to any warehouse - change/update of grid can be done remotely
            \end{itemize} & \begin{itemize}
                \item GPS indoors is not precise enough
                \item pallet detection as a separate problem
            \end{itemize}
