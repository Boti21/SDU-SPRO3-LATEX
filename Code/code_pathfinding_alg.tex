\subsection{Pathfinding}

One of the requirements of the this project is the autonomy of the vehicle - the forklift.
Based on the sensor readings the forklift needs to do decisions. This is done in most of
the essential algorithms of the forklift. All these algorithms conclude in the pathfinding.

\subsubsection{The warehouse layout}

The pathfinding algorithm is tied to the layout of the warehouse.
