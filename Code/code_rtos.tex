    \subsection{FreeRTOS}
    \subsubsection{Why FreeRTOS}
    When designing a autonomous vehicle factors like: precise timing,
    responsiveness, and predictability are crucial for the software.
    If the software dose not process inputs from sensors fast enough it could
    result in a accident. These factors can be forfeited by using a real-time
    operating system like FreeRTOS. With RTOS task scheduling, actions like
    stopping movement when a obstacle is blocking the way, is executed within a
    specified time constraint. Meaning that the action of stopping the vehicle
    is not blocked by another action, thus preventing accidents.

    \subsubsection{FreeRTOS flavor}
    One of the reasons we choose the ESP32 MCU was to utilize its capability
    with FreeRTOS. The ESP32 liberty uses a custom made flavor made for the
    ESP32 by Espressif. One of the key difference for this flavor is its
    support for Dual-Core processors. Meaning that tasks can be distributed
    across two cores, instead of the original one core support in FreeRTOS.
