\subsection{OLED}
The screen was using the I2C protocol to communicate with the MCU and a driver was needed. Luckily there was one on Github which was sufficient but when multiple subsystems
were connected to the ESP32 there were no pins left for the OLED and hence it was not a priority to have it, further implementation and work
on it was halted. The final version of the code does have functions and logic to use it and display the weight of the pallet
and the battery voltage.
