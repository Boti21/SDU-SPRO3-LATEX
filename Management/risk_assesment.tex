\subsection{Risk Assessment}
Engineers have the important responsibility to make sure that the products
they develop are safe and live up to the project goals. Therefore, a
risk assessment is an important part in each project. As this is a student/learning
project it makes sense to do two risk assessments. Hence, there are two assessments to be made: 
One for the project itself as a project (teamwork, workflow etc.) and one for the product (potential risks to 
operation and customer). The probabilities here were estimated as it is not in the scope of 
this project to make tests on multiple instances of the project. Hence, the risk probabilities were estimated 
based on difficulties encountered during the development of the forklift.

The risk assessment for the group work will be shown now as the countermeasures will be 
elaborated on in the following paragraphs.
