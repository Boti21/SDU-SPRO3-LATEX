    \section{Stage division}
    Why divide the project up into multiple smaller stages? It means
    that there will be multiple deadlines, this helps keep the project on
    track. Keeping the project on track in the early stages contributes to the
    final stages where more issues may occur, this mens that there is always a
    working earlier version to showcase if it becomes necessary. It is also
    earlier for both the customer and the development team to see how the
    project will turn out and if there are any design mistakes that have to be
    changed before the final version.

    It is impotent for this method to work, that each stage is clearly defined.
    This ensures that all features for each stage are implemented.

    \textbf{Stage 1:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Stage 2:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Stage 3:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
