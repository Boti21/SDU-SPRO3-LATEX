    \subsection{Technical requirements}
        In order to select certain parts for the project some technical requirements 
        have to be estimated. These include, but are not limited to the mass of the 
        payload, the mass of the vehicle and the desired operating speed of the 
        forklift.

        \subsubsection{Payload} % https://www.cask.com/cans/can-tech-specs/https://baixican.en.made-in-china.com/product/ydUGIOqHCQfi/China-Soda-Can-Packaging-with-Easy-Open-Ends-for-12oz-16oz-250ml-330ml-473ml-500ml-Beverage-Drink.html so far I did not find a paper that would tell me can dimensions
           The group agreed that the payload, for modeling purposes, will be cans of soda.

                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Forklift can lift a pallet of 4 european standard sized cans. Individual can dimensions: Width: 66.1 mm; Height: 115.2 mm; Volume: 0.33 L. % As per a chinese can manufacturer 
                    \item Forklift can lift  2 kg of mass. This includes 4 cans and a pallet. % 1.3 kg for the cans, pallet max 200-300 g, rest should be capacity for errors
                    \item Dimensions of the pallet should be 150 mm by 150 mm. % 2 cans across with ~20 mm to spare
                    \item Payload can be lifted at least 150 mm high. % Pallet can be around 30 mm tall
                \end{enumerate}
